        In this project, kids draw a flower, and add code that makes it bloom. It starts from very small, and grows to normal size and beyond: <br>
        <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/01.png" alt="figure">
        <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/02.png" alt="figure">
        <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/03.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see the end result here:

    <div class="celltitle">Step 1: Drawing</div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        The trick is that we draw the green parts (the stem and leaves) and the colorful flower part (the blossom) separately as different sprites. Use the circle tool and the line tool: <br>
        <img class="figure" width="20%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/04.png" alt="figure">
        <img class="figure" width="20%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/05.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure the flower part is well centered, so that it won't change its position when growing: <br>
        <img class="figure" width="25%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/06.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are ready, place the two sprtes in the stage so that they align perfectly. Make sure the flower part is the last you move, so that it will be in the front: <br>
        <img class="figure" width="25%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/07.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
    </div> <!-- cell -->

    <div class="celltitle">Step 2: Coding</div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        The idea is that the flower part starts as very small, and then grows at each mouse click. This is a good exercise at when to use a "set" block and when its "change" counterpart. At the beginning, the flower is set to a small size: <br>
        <img class="figure" width="20%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/08.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
        The flower changes its size at each mouse click. You can make the growth simple, or use a "repeat" block for a smoother growth: <br>
        <img class="figure" width="25%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/09.png" alt="figure">
        <img class="figure" width="25%" src="curriculum/img/eng/bloomingflower/10.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
        ...And you are ready! :) Look how simple and amazing your animation is.
