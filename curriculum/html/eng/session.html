      This guide provides a detailed plan on how to prepare for and conduct a session in Afterschool Geekery.

    <p>
      Start preparing for a session the day before. Choose a project to create with the participants. By default, this will be one from this curriculum; but we encourage you to prepare your own original projects, or borrow projects from other sources. If you decide to use such a project in your session, please contact Peter for a brief discussion on how the project can be best customized for teaching underprivileged kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a good idea to choose the next project idea at the end of each session, before the kids leave. This way they will not feel that they are forced to work on something that they are not interested in. Instead, they will Feel engaged in the project from the first moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading the project guide, create your own version. While recreating the project, keep in mind how you would teach each part, being as interactive and engaging as possible.<br>

    <p>
      Always arrive at least 15 minutes before the session, so that you can arrange the technical equipment. Unpack and switch on the kids' laptops, check internet connection, connect your laptop to the projector or monitor that you use when teaching, and open the final version of the project so that you can present it to the kids. If the kids have difficulties with typing usernames and passwords, sign them on their laptops. If you use a project that remixes an initial version (like the Dino game, where the graphics and some of the code are included in  blank project), open it in each kid's laptop.

      The first 5-10 minutes of the session will presumably be spent on the arrival of the kids. Don't rush them, give them time to arrive and set up for the session. Don't let them sit at their laptops yet. In the first part of the session, your full attention will be on each other. It is a good idea to remove the chairs from the desks, and form a circle out of them, so the laptops don't steal the kids' attention. If this is not possible, you can form a circle standing, or if everyone is comfortable with that, sitting on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once everyone is ready, start the session with a 5-10 minute icebreaking game, like the ones we used during the mentor training. If an icebreaker is too much for the kids, a quick check-in round can be equally good; everyone says one sentence about themselves, how they are, what happened to them in the previous week. These games and rituals can help a lot building a community, and getting the kids ready for the project work.<br>

      Give the kids a short presentation of the project you will work on, and briefly discuss together how you can break down the project work into steps, and order these steps should be taken, starting from the most important ones (must have), and moving towards the less important ones (nice to have). If a new tool is introduced (like lists, message broadcasting, cloning, or custom blocks), mention them, and describe how cool they are. If you show enthusiasm about the project, kids will presumably get enthusiastic, too.<br>

    <p>
      After the discussion, kids can sit at their laptops, and you can start building the project, following the steps you discussed earlier. Make sure you keep the kids engaged, asking them questions, and paying attention to their answers. A good project work is interactive, so that kids feel that they are part of the creative process, and consequently the success of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Answers to your questions will also provide you with feedback on whether the kids can follow what's going on, or are getting lost. Don't let the project work turn into a mechanical exercise where you do the project work alone, and kids merely copy you. However, if some of the kids are not willing to actively participate, there's no need to pressure them. Some kids need time to open up, be patient and try to understand their conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If necessary, have short breaks during the project work to discuss the next step, to solve technical difficulties, or to play a quick activity helping the kids to capture a new concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the project work, encourage kids to ask questions, and come up with new ideas. These interruptions are in fact the most important results of your teaching, proving that the kids have a sense of participation and partnership. Don't forget that most of them have developed a frustration with all kinds of learning, and each interaction adds a little towards a more balanced attitude and improves their confidence.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      There is no bad idea. An idea that leads nowhere adds a very useful experience to the process of discovering knowledge. Make sure kids realize that the road towards the solution of a problem always goes through several failed attempts, thus failed attempts are a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ideas, however good they are, lead just too far, and implementing them would make the completion of your project work impossible. Make sure you reject these with positive feedback, emphasizing that the idea is, instead of being bad, is too good to implement during the session. Some of these ideas can be seeds for projects later in the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encourage kids to let you know if they get lost or mess up the project in their laptops. Take time to help them, and if possible, get the other kids involved in solving the problem. Give them positive feedback, emphasizing that making mistakes and getting lost from time to time are parts of learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't worry if you can't finish the project according to your original plans. If you are running out of time, or the kids are too tired to continue, just wrap it up. Tell the kids that you are ready and the project is amazing as it is, so that kids get a feeling of success.

    <p>
      Make sure that you always leave enough time for the kids to present their own works to the group. There will always be differences between their version of the project, and yours. Observe these and appreciate them. If a project is broken, encourage them to still present it, finding and fixing the problem together. Make sure everyone is proud of their achievement.

    <p>
      After the session, make sure you have enough time to pack the laptops and other technical equipment. Some of the kids may stay with you, and you can use this time for valuable conversations. While tidying the room, you can discuss next week's project, or anything that comes up and is important for the kids.
