            The Scratch projects presented below are NOT meant to be developed in a project work. Instead, their purpose is to provide fun and useful activities for kids before project work as warm-up exercises, or after project work as rewards, especially if some of them are lacking basic counting and measuring skills. Feel free to spend as much time with them as needed; be careful though, they are addictive! :)

    <div class="celltitle"> Arrange the letters </div>
    <div class="cell">
        <p>
            In this game, the player can drag and drop letters to rearrange them into one of 120 well-known kid-friendly words. The game has an "Easy" and a "Hard" difficulty level. In "Easy" mode, only two letters of the word are swapped; eg. "WINDOW" appears as "WNIDOW" or "OINDWW". In hard mode, the order may be more chaotic, like "WNOWDI" or "INWOWD".
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the letter-shuffling algorithm, it may happen in both modes that the original word, "WINDOW" is displayed (the first and the last letters are swapped, which leaves the word unaltered). In this case, the player just has to move any of the letters a bit, and then the game senses the result.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the player cannot recognize a shuffled word, they can simply click on "PASS" to move to the next one.

            This is a classic "hit and dodge" game. Colored letters are falling downwards, while we see a word in gray in the background. Using the left and right arrow keys, the player has to hit all colored letters that occur in the gray word, while dodging all letters that are not in the word, or have been already collected. The vocabulary of the game is the same as that of the previous one.

            In this game, a voice tells a sentence, and the player has to choose all letters of the sentence from an alphabet, and put them into their place. In "Easy" mode, some of the letters are already at place; in "Hard" mode, the text is completely blank at start.
