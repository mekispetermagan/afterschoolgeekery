    <p>
      In this guide, we'll make a strikingly simple, fun little animation that you can create in a session with complete beginners and little ones alike. Here's the end result:
    </p>

    <p>
      In the project, the kids first arrange the letters of their own names on the stage, and make them dance. Then they draw a self-portrait, and make it dance, too. Finally, music downloaded from YouTube completes the attraction.
    </p>
  </div> <!--  -->

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 1 </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      First of all, choose the initial letter of your name. There are letters among the Scratch sprites, you can choose from them clicking the “Letters” button at the top:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/1_1.png" height="30px" alt="figure">
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/1_2.png" width="40%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      You can color the chosen letter in the graphic editor, or even bring it to life by adding arms and legs:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/1_3.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
    </p>
  </div> <!-- cell -->

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 2 </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Now for the other letters. If you like, you can draw them yourself:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/2_1.png" width="25%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done, for example, by clicking into an ellipse with an eraser set to very large
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/2_2.png" height="30px" alt="figure">,
      reshaping it so that it has an accent, and finally filling it with a color gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you can click on the
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/2_3.png" height="30px" alt="figure">
      icon and use the graphical font editor tool, choosing the font you find the coolest:
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/2_4.png" height="30px" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/2_5.png" width="20%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you can decide not to use the letter itself, but an object similar to the letter, like we did with the lightning bolt turned vertically:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/2_6.png" width="25%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever choose, you'll soon see kids’ names on Scratch stages made up of customized letters:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/2_7.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that each letter is a separate sprite, otherwise we cannot move them separately. Check that the letters of the name are also separated on the thumbnail images below the stage:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/2_8.png" width="25%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      If incidentally two or more letters have been added to the same sprite, or even worse, to the background, you can help by creating a new sprite and then copy-pasting it.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- cell -->

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 3 </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      It's time to move the first letter. There are lots of ways to do this, but spinning is very popular with kids. The code for this is well known from the introductory sessions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/3_1.png" width="20%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want, you can also add a back-and-forth spin to the sprite's movement:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/3_2.png" width="20%" alt="figure">
    </p>
  </div> <!-- cell -->

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 4 </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      You can even leave it up to the children to animate the following letters, if they already have some experience. For example, one can slide back and forth:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/4_1.png" width="35%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Another can change its color with the color effect blocks:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/4_2.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Another one may change its size:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/4_3.png" width="25%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Or shake like a fool:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/4_4.png" width="25%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      And so on, the possibilities are endless. Come up with many ideas, and work together to turn them into Scratch code.
    </p>

      If you've made it this far, you'll have a sense of success. Choose a background for your project and start sharing and liking.

    <p>
      But if you feel like continuing, the best is yet to come.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- cell -->

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 6 </div>

    <p>
      Now include yourselves in the project. No need to complicate the drawing; in vector mode, you can draw a few rectangles and circles to make a great human figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/6_1.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add a dress made of reshaped rectangles, a face with a few lines, and hair made of either lines or ellipses. The drawing is not meant to look exactly like you, so take it easy and use your imagination! :)
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/6_2.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
    </p>
  </div> <!-- cell -->

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 7 </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Now we'll make the newly drawn figure dance. First of all, we need four copies of his costume. To duplicate, right-click on the thumbnail of the costume and in the pop-up menu, click on duplicate:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/7_1.png" width="25%" alt="figure">
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/7_2.png" width="15%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      The second and the fourth picture will be edited by tilting the figure’s arms, legs, and head first one way, and then the opposite way. No need to aim for perfection here either! :) But if something really goes wrong, feel free to make more duplicates of the original costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/7_3.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/7_4.png" width="33%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the code. It's very simple, since we only need to change costumes continuously, with a small delay so that the movement is not too fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/7_5.png" width="20%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, you can once again complete the project successfully, but if you still have the stamina, you can make it perfect with a last few minutes of effort.

      The last step is to add music to the dance. Search Youtube for your favorite music. You don't have to listen to it all, you just need the link to the video.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_1.png" width="40%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      In the address bar of your browser, mark and copy the link (url) to the video:
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_2.png" height="30px" alt="figure">.
      Some of the participants may not know what the browser is and where the address bar is, so take the time to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many online web apps for downloading youtube music; unfortunately, not all of them work reliably and you can never be sure that they will be gone by next week. At the time of writing this lesson, https://mp3-convert.org/ was stable. Before the session, it is worth testing to see if it is still working and finding another one if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open the download page, copy and paste the link to the youtube video into the search box and click "Convert".
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_3.png" width="45%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversion will take a minute or two; then click on the "Download" button to download the mp3 file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_4.png" width="45%" alt="figure">
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_5.png" width="45%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Now go back to Scratch and click on "Sounds" next to the "Costumes" tab for the last sprite you drew:
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_2.png" height="30px" alt="figure">.
      Select the upload option at the bottom left. The file will probably be in your "Downloads" folder, depending on your system and browser settings. (If it's not there, run a search or check your browser settings.) After a successful upload, the file will appear in your sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_7.png" width="15%" alt="figure">
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_8.png" width="40%" alt="figure">
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8_9.png" width="40%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      You just need to add the code for the music playback to the project:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/dance/8-10.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      ...And we're done! :) Take a look at the finished projects one by one, then start sharing and liking.
