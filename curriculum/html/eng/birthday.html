    <p>
      This is a fun little animation with multiple sprites that all have the same code. Perfect for kids who already have a bit of experience with Scratch. It is suitable for younger kids. This project is a great choice when someone in the group has their birthday. However, you can easily adapt the project for other occasions like Holidays (Christmas, Easter, Mother's day) or other occasions (birth of a sibling, marriage in the family etc.)

      Create a new project and say goodbye to Scratchie. Move your mouse pointers over the cat head icon at the bottom right, and when the menu pops up, click on the paintbrush icon to draw a new sprite. Let everyone choose a fun  background for their project. <br>

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 1: Drawing the message </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Let's start with the birthday message. This is the sprite you have created a moment ago. Discuss with the kids how the message should look like. One possible result of the discussion is that it will be written on a rectangular board. So, use the rectangle tool to draw the board: Then write the message with the text tool using a different color. Resize the text if necessary. Assure the kids that it doesn't have to be perfect, so that they shouldn't stress about it.<br>

      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/05.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring the message alive, it will be useful to have two slightly different costumes. Right-click on the thumbnail icon on the left, and select "Duplicate". Now everyone should slightly alter the two costumes. Discuss the various options: they may differ in color, size, font, they can be tilted slightly in opposite directions etc. Let everyone come up with their own version.<br>

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 2: Animating the message </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      The simplest way to animate a sprite is changing its costume. In this project, this will be done with every sprite. The code is very easy, and most likely it is already familiar for the kids. First, find the block that makes the sprite replace its current costume with the next one. Then place it under a "green flag" block, and nest it in a "forever" block. Remember not to just tell kids what to do, but to ask them what they think is needed for the code, and make your decisions together based on their ideas.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/09.png" alt="figure"><br>
      The costume change is insanely fast, so it is a good idea to insert a "wait" block in the code.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/10.png" alt="figure"><br>
      But now it is too slow...
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is the first time to use decimal fractions during the course, it's time for a discussion. Especially if the kids are small, still in lower grades. Keep asking questions until you get good enough answers from the kids to finalize the code. Are there numbers that are smaller than 1? What is larger than zero, yet smaller than 1? Is there a time that's shorter than 1 second? An olympic athlete runs 10 meters in one second. A cheetah runs twice as fast, so instead of one second it needs...? How do you write one half with digits? And so on, whatever comes to your mind. Don't forget to mention that in computing we use decimal dots instead of decimal commas that are usual in Hungary, Slovakia, or Ukraine, because the Americans use decimal dots. The whole conversation will not take more than two minutes, but kids will learn a lot by the time they figure out how to set their time intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether decimal fractions need to be discussed or not, make sure kids set the values according to their liking. Some of them want it to be slower, others faster. Let them try different versions, restarting their projects as many times as needed, until they find their own pace. Kids shouldn't ever just copy your code.<br>

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 3: Adding further sprites </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      It's time to add further sprites to the project. To spare time, let's use ready made ones with the cat head icon once again, but this time choosing the option at the bottom. Every birthday deserves a cake, so this may be your first choice to add. A birthday is also a good occasion to throw a party, so another idea may be clicking on "Dance" at the top of the sprite collection, and adding a few dancing sprites to the project. Let the kids arrange the stage until all their sprites find their places.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/12.png" alt="figure">
      <img class="figure" width="35%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/13.png" alt="figure">
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/14.png" alt="figure">
      <img class="figure" width="60%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/15.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are running out of time, forget about the dancers and just add the cake to the project. You can finish the project work without even animating the cake. The project will still look cool.

  <div class="celltitle"> Copying code </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      There are many ways to copy code from one sprite to another. Here we will use the backpack tool, but if you and the kids are comfortable with dragging the code to the thumbnail of another sprite or using Ctrl C, Ctrl V, feel free to use that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with opening the backpack. If this is the first time, notice how funny it is that it was there all time long, and you didn't ever realize! :)<br>
      <img class="figure" width="60%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/16.png" alt="figure"><br>
      Now select the message sprite, and drag its code into the backpack:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="60%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/17.png" alt="figure">
      <img class="figure" width="60%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/18.png" alt="figure"><br>
      Now select another sprite (the cake, the dancers, or whatever you added to the project), and drag the code from the backpack to the script area.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="60%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/19.png" alt="figure"><br>
      Tadaaa, success! When kids restart the code, they see that another sprite starts to move. Keep doing this until every sprite gets moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backpack is a very useful tool. You can carry scripts, costumes, sounds, or whole sprites in it, and move them even to another project.
    </p>

  <div class="celltitle"> Step 4: Playing music </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      If you have some time left, let's add sound to the project, don't let your dancers move without music. The birthday cake has a nice birthday tune. Use it under another "green flag" block: <br>
      <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/birthday/20.png" alt="figure"><br>
      If some of the kids don't like the birthday tune, some of the dancers have pretty cool music, let them use that. Just make sure the same sprite has the sound you chose and the sound playing blocks. And, of course, whatever tune you choose, you can loop it with a "forever" block:<br>
