      This is a minimalistic interactive animation: the cat keeps looking at the mouse pointer, wherever it is. The code is just three blocks, and the graphics part is easy. It can be done in 30 minutes. You can see the final result here:

  <div class="celltitle">Preparations</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Create a new project. Good news: this time you don't need to delete Scratchie. The cat has nice big eyes, which make our job animating them easy. Use the "Size" tool under the stage to make Scratchie large:<br>

  <div class="celltitle">Step 1: Hiding the blacks of the eyes</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Now discuss with the kids what is the easiest way to make the blacks of Scratchie's eyes disappear. We will assume that you chose painting it white; but you can also delete it with the reshape tool, or with the select tool and the delete icon (after ungrouping the head); or just covering them with white circles. Click on the "Costumes" tab to open the graphic editor. Blend the white color with the fill color tool (slide saturation to zero, and brightness to 100). Select the bucket fill tool, and click on the blacks of the cat's eyes to make them disappear. (If you accidentally click on the wrong part, jus use the Undo tool.) Now poor Scratchie is blind, but don't worry, her new eyes will be even cuter!<br>

  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Now move your mouse pointer over the blue cat icon under the stage, and when the menu pops up, click on the paintbrush to draw a new sprite. Blend the black color with the fill color tool (slide brightness to zero). Click a few times on the magnifier icon with the plus sign to zoom in. Use the circle tool to draw a new pupil for the cat. (Tip: if you hold down the Shift key, the circle will be perfect.) You can see the real size of the shape on the stage. It is a good idea to make the pupil larger than the original, but still small enough to fit in the cat's eye.<br>

      <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/eyeroll/08.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle will need to always point towards the mouse pointer. If it is at the center, the rotation will not be visible. If it is far from the center, the circle will rotate out of the cat's eye. It has to be just a little bit off from the center. But in which direction? Click on "90" near "Direction" under the stage to check where the sprite is pointing at. It's pointing right; so the circle has to be off to the right, as well.<br>

      <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/eyeroll/10.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready, place the circle in one of Scratchie's eyes; again, slightly off to the right, where the cat is looking right now.<br>

  <div class="celltitle">Step 3: Code the new sprite</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      The cat will always look towards the mouse pointer. This coding task may be familiar to the kids. It is similar to the very first piece of code you made, with the cat moving around in circles; except this time there is no need for the "move" block. Once you realize this, putting the blocks together will be easy:<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      It's finally time to start the project, and test the project for the first time. If the black of the eye is too large, too small, or too much off to the side, just go back to the graphic editor and adjust it.

  <div class="celltitle">Step 4: The other eye</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Finally, let's take care of the other eye. It would be nice to spare the hard work of doing everything once again, wouldn't it? Ask the kids if they have an idea. They will surely know that duplicating the sprite is an option. Do that, and place the new sprite in the other eye of the cat.<br>

      Restart the project and test it once again.

  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      If you still have time left, let the kids customize the cat. They can paint it to their favorite color, draw a moustache, add a cap, or anything of their liking. Also let them add their favorite background. And don't forget about the kids' presentations! :)<br>
