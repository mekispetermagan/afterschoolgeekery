        If you've never used Scratch before and don't know how to get started, this guide will get you started. If you've played Scratch before, but not much, then scroll through it to see if there's anything important you missed before. And if you're an experienced Scratcher, feel free to skip this guide.

        Scratch is a programming language, a tool to explain to a computer what it should do. Scratch's player (interpreter) obediently executes your instructions. So you can program animations and video games, tell a story, or even make a presentation; Scratch makes it quick and easy to put together spectacular projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scratch is a visual programming language in which instructions to the machine are not typed in a text document, but put together on the screen from color blocks. The color and shape of the blocks reflect their functions, so it's very easy to learn what they are for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scratch has been developed by the world's leading university of engineering, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, for over 20 years, and is used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide to teach programming to 8 to 16 year olds (a version for younger kids called Scratch Junior is also being developed).

    <div class="celltitle">Why is Scratch good?</div>
    <div class="cell">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Because Scratch turns programming into a game. Kids don't even realize they're learning.<br>
          <img src="curriculum/img/eng/intro/03.png" width="80%" alt="figure">
        </li>
        <li>
          Because the visual interface makes programming easily accessible for those with literacy difficulties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because the emphasis is not on the math and technology side of programming, but on creativity. We can give children who have had only failures in math or IT education at school a positive learning experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because, all in all, Scratch is a great tool for software developers and a great way to prepare children to learn modern programming languages.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The easiest way to access Scratch is online <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">on the Scratch website</a> but if you don't have a stable internet connection <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/download">you you can also download</a> the Scratch app. In this guide, we'll cover the online interface, but the downloaded and installed software works exactly the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, you will need laptops; one for each child, and one for you, the teacher. If you don't have a laptop, a desktop computer is also fine. You can use Scratch on a tablet with a large enough screen (at least 8 inches), but in our experience working on a smaller tablet or phone is inconvenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a good idea to have a mouse for the laptops; children's hands are often not yet dexterous enough to use the touchpad effectively. You'll also need a projector or a large monitor that the kids can watch while you're working.

        If you see the Scratch page in a different language, you should switch languages right at the beginning by selecting your language from the list at the bottom of the page:<br>
        <img src="curriculum/img/eng/intro/05.png" width="95%" alt="figure"><br>
        Scratch is available in 80+ languages, including many Africal and Asian ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these guides, we will use Scratch in English, but you will find everything easily in your preferred language, as well.

        Choose a username and password. It's best to save these so that you don't have any problems later. Enter your requested details and email address. Please enter an email address that you actually use, because you will not be able to share a project until you confirm your registration by clicking the blue button in the email you receive from Scratch:<br>

      <p>
        After registering, you should go straight into Scratch and create your first project, which will already be saved in the system.You can start a new project by clicking on "Create".<br>

        Scratch's interface is a bit complex at first glance, but it's very intuitive and easy to navigate:<br>

        1. On the header marked in yellow you can
        <ul>
          <li>
            click on the orange button to share a project<br>
            <img src="curriculum/img/eng/intro/11.png" width="30%" alt="figure">

            <img src="curriculum/img/eng/intro/14.png" width="60%" alt="figure">
          </li>
        </ul>
        and you can find many other useful things here, feel free to explore the possibilities!
      </p>
      <p>
        2. n the section marked orange, you will find Scratch blocks of different colors. You can use them to build the program code. In the following tutorials you will gradually get to know them.<br>
        <img src="curriculum/img/eng/intro/15.png" width="40%" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The large empty area marked in green is called script area; you can build code from the blocks here. Blocks placed here with the mouse will automatically connect if they are close enough together.<br>
        <img src="curriculum/img/eng/intro/16.png" width="40%" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The part marked in blue is the Scratch stage. This is where the program you are creating will run, filling the stage with spectacular animations. You can most often start a program by clicking on the green flag icon, and stop it by clicking on the stop-sign icon. Click on the top right icons to enlarge or shrink the stage as required.<br>
        <img src="curriculum/img/eng/intro/17.png" width="60%" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        5.In the purple area below the stage, you can choose which sprite you want to work with. Scratchie kitten is the only sprite to begin with, but you will work with more than one sprite in almost every project. You can add a new sprite to a project by clicking on the kitten head icon at the bottom right, and you can add a new background by clicking on the small picture icon.

      </p>
      <p>
        In Scratch, we use program code to give tasks to sprites (and possibly the background). Before editing a sprite's code, click on its thumbnail to select it. In the same area, you can set the basic properties of the sprites under the stage. Feel free to try them out!<br>

      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, there are two more important tools to explore right from the start. The first is the graphic editor, which you can open by clicking on the "Costumes" tab in the block interface at the top left. This offers a wealth of options, which we will explore in a separate guide.<br>
        <img src="curriculum/img/eng/intro/19.png" width="80%" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        The other is the sound editor, which opens by clicking on the "Sounds" tab in the same window. This has much more limited options, but well-chosen sounds can really enhance the experience of a project.<br>

        If you like the project you have opened, you should express this by clicking on the heart icon below. If you want to find the project later, you can add it to your favorites by clicking on the star icon. And finally, you can comment on each other's projects:<br>

        If you click on the username under the title of the opened project, the profile page of the person will be displayed.You can also open it directly by typing "scratch.mit.edu/users/username" in the browser's address field (with the actual username instead of "username", of course):<br>

        You can follow the user by clicking on the "follow" button on the profile page (the English translation doesn't always keep up with changes in the Scratch interface).This way you will be notified when a new project is shared:<br>

        In the profile page, you can also find their shared projects, as well as those who follow them and who they follow, so you can easily find other people you know in common:<br>
