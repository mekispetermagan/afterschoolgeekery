  <div class="celltitle">1. Building</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Each yellow box contains one full set of lego parts for building various robots. There are a few special parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hub</b>: This is a minicomputer. It is the brain and heart of the robot.It receives information from the sensors, makes decisions based on the information, and moves the motors accordingly.  It also contains the battery. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/102.jpg" width="45%" alt="figure">

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Motors</b>: There are one large and two small motors in the set. These can move various parts of your robot: turn wheels, raise an arm, turn the head, rotate the propeller, wag the tail, etc. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/103.jpg" width="45%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sensors</b>: the distance sensor looks like a pair of eyes, and it detects how close an object is. The color sensor looks like a lamp, and it detects the main color of an object in front of it. The touch sensor looks like a button, and it is sensitive to pressure. All sensors report the information they detect to the hub. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/104.jpg" width="45%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the set consists mainly of larger bits with holes, and small bits that fit in the holes and connect the larger bits. <br>

  <div class="celltitle">2. Setting up the app</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      You can program your robots offline (from your computers, without internet) or online (using a web app). In both cases, start opening <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/spike-app/software/">this website in the Chrome browser</a>. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/201.png" width="60%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the offline app, just click Download, and install the downloaded file. To work online, click on the downward arrow on the right, and click on “Launch web app”. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/202.png" width="60%" alt="figure"><br>
      The offline and the online apps have the same interface. Here we present the web app, but everything is just about the same in the offline app as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, select Spike Prime. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/203.png" width="70%" alt="figure"><br>
      Confirm that you have a set to connect. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/204.png" width="70%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Now click on “New project” (not “Start”). <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/205.png" width="50%" alt="figure"><br>
      Select “Word blocks”. This will be practically a version of Scratch. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/206.png" width="50%" alt="figure"><br>
    </p>

  <div class="celltitle">3. Connecting the hub</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      To connect your robot to the app, click on the yellow circle. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/301.png" width="55%" alt="figure"><br>
      Switch on your robot by pressing the large button on the hub. Press the small button with the bluetooth symbol. Select the color of your button (green or white). <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/302.png" width="70%" alt="figure"><br>
      If you see an "open" button, click on it. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/303.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is the first time to connect your hub, bluetooth connection may not be possible until you update the hub. If this is the case, the appearing list of compatible devices will be empty. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/304.png" width="60%" alt="figure"> <br>
      If this is the case, close the list and select the USB option instead of bluetooth. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/305.png" width="40%" alt="figure"><br>
      Use the white USB cable to connect the hub to your computer. Now the list will not be empty. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/306.png" width="60%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      At first connection you will either be prompted to update your hub, or the update will start automatically. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/307.png" width="30%" alt="figure">
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/308.png" width="50%" alt="figure"> <br>
      After update you can name your robot as you like. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/309.png" width="40%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      After updating you can connect your hub either via blootooth or via USB.
    </p>
  </div> <!-- cell -->

  <div class="celltitle">4. Programming the robot</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      When the hub is successfully connected to your computer, the yellow circle in the app turns white with a green check symbol, and each motor and sensor is indicated with an icon, along with the letter of the port they are plugged in. <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/401.png" width="50%" alt="figure"><br>
      Now you can start putting together your code. Use the yellow “event” blocks for the sensors, and the blue “motion” blocks for themotors. The rest is just plain Scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a sample code for wagging a dog's tail when an object gets close to the distance sensor: <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/402.png" width="60%" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Another one to move a robot's wheels back and forth when the color sensor detects yellow: <br>
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/403.png" width="60%" alt="figure"> <br>
      These scripts will be explained in detail in the next guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your code is ready, click the yellow arrow at the bottom right to start it on the robot:
      <img src="curriculum/img/eng/robotintro/404.png" width="30%" alt="figure"> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      ...And you are all set! Nothing compares to the experience of the first successful movement of your robot. Enjoy! :)
