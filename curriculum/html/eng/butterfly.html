      This is a very simple little animation that starts from a single drawing, but it's quite spectacular. You can see the end result here:

  <div class="celltitle">Step 1: Drawing the butterfly</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Click on the little bin icon to delete Scratchie the cat. Hover the mouse over the kitten head icon in the bottom right corner and click on the small brush in the menu that appears to draw a new sprite.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="50%" src="curriculum/img/eng/butterfly/1.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't feel like drawing, you can skip this whole section by clicking on the magnifying glass icon instead of the brush, and selecting the finished butterfly sprite.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      When the graphic editor appears, you can start drawing as usual, using the circle tool. It is a good idea to start with the butterfly's body and head. When you are more experienced, you can color them with a gradient.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/butterfly/3.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we're ready for one wing. You can also color this with a gradient. Use the reshape tool to get the final shape, and draw nice colorful patterns on it.<br>

      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/butterfly/6.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you're happy with one wing, you can move on to the other. This one is ready in one step, as you just need to copy and the one that is ready. Select the wing, then click on the copy and paste icons above. Drag the second wing into place, and flip it horizontally using the flip icon at the top.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      If you like, you can even perfect the result by using the line tool and the reshaping tool to add tentacles on it.<br>

      Duplicate the costume, then mark and narrow the wings of the butterfly a little. Repeat this a few times until they are completely thinned. This is how the butterfly closes its wings.<br>

      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/butterfly/19.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you do the same thing in reverse, the wings will open. By the end of the process you will have ten to twelve costumes.<br>

  <div class="celltitle">Step 3: The program code</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      After all that drawing, it will be nice to do some coding. The first step is to make the butterfly smaller, so that it has room to fly around the stage.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/butterfly/20.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the wing movement code. This will be a simple costume change with a bit of delay.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/butterfly/21.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      The code for flying is just as simple: you glide the sprite to a random position over and over again.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="35%" src="curriculum/img/eng/butterfly/22.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, choose a nice background behind the butterfly. And don't forget to give each other a demonstration! :)<br>
