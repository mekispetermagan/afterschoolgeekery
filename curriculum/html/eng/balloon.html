      This is one of the simplest projects, so you can start it with beginners and small kids. It can be put together in 30 minutes, but with extra features discussed together, it can fill a whole session. You can see the end result here:

      You need two sprites: a balloon and someone to blow it. As for the balloon, it's easiest to use Scratch's built-in one. The other sprite can be anyone, but the elephant has a really cute trumpeting costume, which is definitely a good choice. So say goodbye to Scratchie cat and delete the poor thing, then click on the bottom right kitten head and select the two sprites for the project:<br>

      Use your mouse to position the two sprites on the stage so that the balloon is right up to the mouth (trunk) of the blowerWhen you have done it, click on the little picture icon at the bottom right to add a background to the project: <br>

  <div class="celltitle">Step 1: Animating the balloon</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      The balloon’s code will be very simple: just change the size. Start with a very small balloon:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/03.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the balloon is gradually starting to grow. To do this, you will need the "change size" block and a few repetitions:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/04.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      What remains is the popping of the balloon simply by hiding it:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/05.png" alt="figure">
      If you restart the project now, you may be a little alarmed to find that the balloon is still missing. The solution is simple, you just have to show it again:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/06.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find that the balloon is growing too fast or not big enough, it's worth playing with the numbers a bit. The smaller the number you write in the "change size" block, the slower the balloon will grow. The bigger the number you put in the "repeat" block, the bigger it gets.<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/07.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've made it this far, you can say the project is done. Be proud of yourself, you have done a good job. But if you have the time and energy, there's still a lot more you can do.

  <div class="celltitle">Step 2: Endless animation</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      The animation will be more spectacular if there is some time between the balloon blowing and the balloon popping:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/08.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, after a break, you can start all over again, endlessly animating:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/09.png" alt="figure"><br>
      Of course, you can also play with the pauses, for example, you can wait half a second between blowing and blowing out, and two seconds between blowing out and blowing again.
    </p>

  <div class="celltitle">Step 3: The elephant’s costume change</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      The elephant has two costumes: the one with the trumpet and the one with the smile. As the animation starts with blowing, it is a good idea to set the blowing costume when clicking on the green flag:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/10.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you finish blowing, switch to the smiling costume.probably easiest to time it by broadcasting a message, so you don't have to do the math:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/11.png" alt="figure">
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/12.png" alt="figure"><br>
      Similarly, you can change back the costume by broadcasting a message:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/balloon/13.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, remember that messages have to be both received and broadcasted. Include the message blocks in the balloon’s code at the appropriate points.<br>
