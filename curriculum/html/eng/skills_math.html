            The Scratch projects presented below are NOT meant to be developed in a project work. Instead, their purpose is to provide fun and useful activities for kids before project work as warm-up exercises, or after project work as rewards, especially if some of them are lacking basic counting and measuring skills. Feel free to spend as much time with them as needed; be careful though, they are addictive! :)

    <div class="celltitle"> Which is more? </div>
    <div class="cell">
        <p>
            In this project, images on the left and the  right display objects in varying quantities, from 1 to 10. The task is to tell which side has more objects, thus practicing the use of the basic arithmetic relation symbols "<", "=", and ">".

    <div class="celltitle"> Math train </div>
    <div class="cell">
        <p>
            This game is inspired by Wordwall's train game. The player has to match arithmetic expressions, like "7-3", with their values, like "4", by popping the balloon that carries "7-3" at the right time, so that "7-3" falls into the wagon of the train with the number "4". (It's simpler in practice than it seems!)
        </p>
        <p>
            The game has three levels of difficulty. In "Easy" mode, values range from 1 to 5. In "Medium" mode, values range from 1 to 9, which makes the game harder, but colors help the player. In "Hard" mode, there are no helping colors.

    <div class="celltitle"> Reading the clock </div>
    <div class="cell">
        <p>
            This game improves kids' skills to read analogue and digital clocks. An analogue clock displays a certain time, and the player has to guess which digital clock shows the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game has two difficulty levels. In "Easy" mode, the digital clock values are in the 12h format, so eg. there is no "18:30", only "6:30". Furthermore, in "Easy" mode minutes are multiples of 15, so any time starting with "6" will be "6:00", "6:15", "6:30", or "6:45".
