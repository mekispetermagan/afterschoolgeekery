            This is a simple fortune teller machine. Well... As the Paranormal Extension of Scratch is not ready yet, we will cheat, and provide random "yes" or "no" answers to the user, whatever they ask.

            Here's the end result of the project work: <br>

            This is a project without sprites. All we have is three background. One for the instructions, one for the answer "yes", and one for the wnswer "no". Say goodbye to Scratchie, and create the three backgrounds. Everyone can design them the way they like. Here we use a minimal approach: <br>
            <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/fortuneteller/01.png" alt="figure">
            <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/fortuneteller/02.png" alt="figure">
            <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/fortuneteller/03.png" alt="figure"> <br>
            Feel free to follow your creative ideas, and draw something more detailed and interesting.

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 2: Writing the code </div>
    <div class="cell">
        <p>
            Let's start with the intro background: <br>
            <img class="figure" width="20%" src="curriculum/img/eng/fortuneteller/04.png" alt="figure"> <br>
            Now we want the user to type a question. We rarely do this, so the "ask" block may be new the kids. We don't really need text prompt, so you can just leave the block empty: <br>
            <img class="figure" width="20%" src="curriculum/img/eng/fortuneteller/05.png" alt="figure"> <br>
            Now if you start the project, you will see the prompt where you can type your question: <br>
            <img class="figure" width="50%" src="curriculum/img/eng/fortuneteller/06.png" alt="figure"> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to randomly choose between "yes" and "no". This is like a coinflip, or throwing a dice that only has two sides. Since the "random" block in Scratch only works with numbers, let's just say "yes" is 1 and "no" is 2. To check which is the case, you'll need an if-then-else block, and change the background accordingly: <br> 
            <img class="figure" width="20%" src="curriculum/img/eng/fortuneteller/07.png" alt="figure"> <br>
            The only tricky part is the condition. The answer is "yes" if the number is 1. Do you remember from math classes, how we write "is" in "Two plus two is four"? Of yourse, with and equals sign! Now it's easy:
            <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/fortuneteller/08.png" alt="figure"> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            ...And you are ready! It was easy, wasn't it? :)
