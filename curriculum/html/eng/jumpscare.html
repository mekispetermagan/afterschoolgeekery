            A Jump Scare is a TikTok trend with roots in classic horror movies. It typically involves
            <ul>
                <li>Displaying a calm screen to make the audience lower their guards</li>
                <li>Suddenly switching to a close-up of a scary face</li>
                <li>Accompanying it with a loud, screaming sound.</li>
            </ul> 
            This project is a Scratch implementation of this meme.

            Here's the end result of the project work: <br>

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 1: Preparing the sprite </div>
    <div class="cell">
        <p>
            Ask kids to chose the sprite they find the cutest. It's ok if some of them copy you in their choice, but encourage them to make their own choices. The sprite they choose should have a face.
        </p>
        <p>
            Go to "Costumes", and duplicate the main costume of the chosen sprite. It is also a good idea to delete the rest to avoid confusions. In the duplicated costume, delete everything except the face. Then select and enlarge the face, so that it fillls the whole stage. Finally, alter the face so that it becomes scary. Kids usually love this part! :) <br>

    <div class="cell">
        <p>
            First of all, we have to disarm the user. Let's start with the normal costume, and let the sprite say something nice to the user. Make sure to increase the time if the text is long: <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            After clicking, switch to the freakish costume: <br>

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 3: Adding the scream </div>
    <div class="cell">
        <p>
            Now let's add the screaming sound. Select the "Sound" tab, and click the speaker icon to select a new sound. There are three nice sound samples: "Scream1" and "Scream2" in "Voice" and "Screech" in "Animal". These are near each other in "All". Choose whichever you like (or a fourth one; or kids may even record their own screams).<br>

            <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/jumpscare/08.png" alt="figure">
        </p>
        <p>
            Go back to "Code", and add a sound block to play the scream: <br>
            <img class="figure" width="35%" src="curriculum/img/eng/jumpscare/09.png" alt="figure">
        </p>
        <p>
            ...And tada!, your project is ready, enjoy the scare! Don't forget to present everyone's project to the group! :)
