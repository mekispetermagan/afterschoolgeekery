      This is a very simple animation that can be made in up to 20 minutes. It's a completely beginner level project, you can even take it to your first session. A heart beats on the stage and changes color. You can see the final result here:

  <div class="celltitle">Step 1: Choosing the sprite</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      Say goodbye to Scratchie the cat, he won't be needed now. Click on the blue cat head icon in the bottom right to open the spite library, and choose your favorite one of the three heart sprites:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="20%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/1.png" alt="figure">
      <img class="figure" width="15%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/2.png" alt="figure">
      <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/3.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
    <p>
      Also choose a background to your liking and place the heart sprite on it:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="15%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/4.png" alt="figure">
      <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/5.png" alt="figure">
    </p>
  </div> <!-- cell -->


  <div class="celltitle">Step 2: Coding</div>
  <div class="cell">
    <p>
      The code for the beating will set the size of the heart varyingly; sometimes larger, sometimes smaller. So, when you click on the green flag, you set the size to a larger value (two hundred if you want a big heart, twenty if you want a very small one), and then after a little delay, a bit smaller (again, to each their liking):<br>
      <img class="figure" width="20%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/6.png" alt="figure"><br>
      To keep it beating, you can put the code in a "forever" block with another delay:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="25%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/7.png" alt="figure"><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart is beating nicely, but very slowly. Before you set the exact values to expect, discuss how fast the heart beats in a minute. You can even measure your pulse by tapping your wrists. The number will be somewhere around 80 in 60 seconds, so a heartbeat lasts a little less than a second. But even that has to be split into two. How? What rhythm does the heart beat at? You can even make a chorus of the rhythm out loud:
      <blockquote><i>Ba-bump, ba-bump, ba-bump</i></blockquote>
      --one short, one long. Set the values accordingly, for example 0.2 and 0.6 seconds (be careful, Scratch uses decimal points instead of the decimal comma you might have learned in school):<br>
      <img class="figure" width="25%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/8.png" alt="figure"><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, the color change.Together, find the block that changes the color effect, set the amount of change to small, and create the second code with a new block "always" and "when clicking on green flag"::<br>
      <img class="figure" width="35%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/9.png" alt="figure"><br>
      Copy the coloring code to the background to make the animation even more spectacular:
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want, you can turn the protect into a very relaxing relaxing animation, slowing down the heartbeat and the color change, and making the difference between small and large very small::<br>
      <img class="figure" width="60%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/10.png" alt="figure"><br>
      Or you can make a vibrant and dynamic animation:<br>
      <img class="figure" width="60%" src="curriculum/img/eng/heartbeat/11.png" alt="figure"><br>
      Aren't numbers such great things? Just by playing with numbers you can change the mood of a project! :)
