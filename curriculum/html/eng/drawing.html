        This guide provides an introduction to creating vector graphics in the Scratch graphics editor. The vector graphics tools are simple to use and make drawing easy for those without good manual dexterity. You can find the images created in this guide in this Scratch project:

    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        The first section introduces you to Scratch's graphical editor. The editor can be used in two different modes; we will only focus on the vector mode.

        It is surprising how much can be drawn with solid circles, rectangles and lines. In the second section, we will practice this.

      <p>
        Once you're comfortable with solid, geometric shapes, you can start to color and reshape them with color transitions (gradients) to get more life-like shapes. In the third section, we'll delve into this.

        Once you're comfortable with complex shapes, you can start copying them and arranging them in patterns to create detailed drawings with little work. The fourth section is devoted to this.

    <div class="section-title"> The Graphic editor </div>

    <div class="celltitle"> What is it? </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="60%" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-1-0.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        You can open the graphic editor by clicking on the "Costumes" tab at the top left:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-1-1.png" alt="figure">.
        The editor always edits the costumes of the selected sprite. And if the stage is selected, you can edit backgrounds, and the tab caption will change:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-1-2.png" alt="figure">.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your sprite has multiple costumes, you can select the costume you want to edit in the bar on the left:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="60px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-1-3.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you can also choose a new costume from the costume, library, create a blank costume or upload an image file from your own computer:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="42px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-1-4.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
    </div> <!-- cell -->

    <div class="celltitle"> Vector image vs bitmap image </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        With Scratch's graphical editor, you can create two types of drawings:
        <ul>
          <li>
            bitmap: this consists of pixels (like when you work with Paint, Gimp, or Photoshop)
          </li>
          <li>
            vector image: this consists of geometric shapes (like when you work with SVG Editor, Inkscape, or Illustrator)
          </li>
        </ul>
        You can switch between the two modes using the "Convert" button:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-2-1.png" alt="figure"> /
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-2-2.png" alt="figure">
        You should use this with caution, as converting will result in data loss. Except in some rare cases, images started in vector graphics mode should be kept as vector graphics.
      </p>
   </div> <!-- cell -->

    <div class="celltitle"> Toolbars </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        The graphical editor has two toolbars; these are located on the left side of the image and above the image. The content of the left toolbar is constant, while the tools on the top change depending on which tool you select on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="15%" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-2-3.png" alt="figure">
        <img class="figure" width="75%" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-2-4.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        These toolbars will be explained in more detail in the following sections, but you can explore them now. If you don't like the results, just click the undo tool:
        <img class="figure" height="40px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-2-5.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
    </div> <!-- cell -->

    <div class="celltitle"> Objects </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        Vector images are made up of separate, often overlapping, colored objects that can be individually selected, resized and moved. Test how many objects make up the cat's costume by clicking on them with your mouse (tip: you can use the "Ungroup" tool to break up the selected composite objects.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/1-2-6.png" alt="figure">

        Start by dressing up Scratchie the cat with colored rectangles, ellipses (elongated circles), and lines.

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 1 </div>

        Let's start with the color editor. Find your desired color by adjusting the three color sliders.

    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        Left-click on the circle tool and drag the mouse slightly diagonally to the right on the drawing surface to get a nice elongated ellipse.
      </p>

        Now click on the selection tool at the left:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/2-3-1.png" alt="figure">,
        and drag the ellipse onto the kitten's forehead.

      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/2-3-2.png" alt="figure">

    </div> <!-- cell -->

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 4 </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        Draw another, less elongated ellipse and draw it over the previous one. Lo and behold, in just a few moves we've made him a pretty decent cap!
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="30%" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/2-4.png" alt="figure">
      </p>
      <p>
        If the dimensions are wrong or an object is out of place, select it again, and adjust it until you're happy with the result. We're not in a hurry! :)

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 5 </div>

        If you prefer hats, you can start drawing with the rectangle tool:

        If you change your mind about a color, click the fill tool:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/2-7-1.png" alt="figure">,
        choose another color from the palette, and click to recolor your objects.

        and even change the outline color and thickness:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/2-8-2.png" alt="figure">.
        o you can even add glasses to the kitten using the circle tool and the line tool

        And so on: with coloured ellipses, rectangles and lines, you can dress up Scratchie cat however you like. Add as many details and make as many versions as you like! :)

        Let’s dress up Scratchie once more, but this time give him a crown. It would be difficult to make this shape out of ellipses and rectangles. But an ellipse will do for a start:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/3-1.png" alt="figure">

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 2 </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        Now click on the reshape icon next to the selection tool:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/3-2-1.png" alt="figure">.
        If you then click on the ellipse, you will see its outline in blue with four control points. You can move these to reshape the ellipse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="figure" width="40%" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/3-2-2.png" alt="figure">

     </div> <!-- cell -->

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 3 </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <p>
        You can also click on the outline to insert new control points. If you want a selected point to be pointed or curved, click on the corresponding icon:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/3-3-1.png" alt="figure">.
        As the points multiply, the crown begins to take shape.

    <div class="celltitle"> Step 4 </div>

        Keep adding and adjusting the dots until you have a pretty little crown.

        Now we give it a little glamour with the Fill tool:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/2-7-1.png" alt="figure">.
        At the top of the palette, there are four options for a gradient:
        <img class="figure" height="30px" src="curriculum/img/eng/drawing/3-5-1.png" alt="figure">.
        As you can guess from their shades, these are:
        <ul>
          <li>no color gradient</li>
          <li>horizontal color gradient</li>
          <li>vertical color gradient</li>
          <li>central color gradient</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose the central color gradient, set the middle color to white and the outer color to yellow, then click on the center of the crown to give it a little shine.<br>

        The crown comes with a robe! You can also start this one with colored ellipses.

        As our drawing skills develop, so does our imagination; we can now easily imagine the finished robe in rudimentary shapes.

      <p>
        Reshape the robe to suit your ideas as much as possible.

      <p>
        Don't be discouraged if something doesn't work the first time. Undo the last step, and try again until you are satisfied with the result. The goal is not perfection, but to experience how easy it is to draw like this!

        Sometimes it's good not to have to keep redrawing the repetitive details of an image. For example, to draw a flower, you only need to work on a single petal.

      <p>
        Draw a heart shape for the petal. It doesn't have to be completely pointed in the middle at the top, just use your mouse to make the guides a little shorter.

        Now it’s time to draw the leaves. It is enough to draw one of these in the usual way, starting from an ellipse, reshaping it and finally filling it in with a color transition.

        Now the leaf can be reproduced. Besides rotating and resizing, you can also mirror one or two of them by clicking on this icon:

        With the flowers and leaves, the whole plant takes shape.

        and use two gradient rectangles to create a background for your plant.
